# NSPS Connector Implementation Guide

> Comprehensive guide to implement connectors between NSPS and external network systems.

## Key Concepts

- **NSPS (New Service Provisioning System)**: Processes events, enriches data, and sends them to the connector.
- **Connector**: Receives events enriched by NSPS, selects the necessary parameters, and sends them to the external system in the format required by that external system.
- **External Network Systems*: Requires updates based on the events received, with each system having its own proprietary API.
